## Note:
Fluorine is in a mostly functional beta, so please note that the desktop may have bugs, or be prone to breaking.

On top of that, currently Fluorine is only made to work on Arch based systems. If you want to install Fluorine on a distribution that is not Arch based, please <a target="blank" href="https://fluorine.sh/packagelist">find and install these packages for your system</a> before executing the install script.

# Fluorine

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://fluorine.sh/install)
