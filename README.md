# Fluorine
## Disclaimer:
Fluorine is being rewritten to be an actual desktop instead of a collection of programs and bash scripts so things may break.

As a daily driver it'll probably be fine though as long as you don't update if everything's fine.

## Installation

On Arch run `bash <(curl -s https://fluorine.sh/install)`

On Manjaro it should be fine but proceed with caution.

To update (which is basically a guessing game of if something will break or not): `bash <(curl -s https://fluorine.sh/install)`
